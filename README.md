# SustainaBOT üåç‚ôªÔ∏è

SustainaBOT is an AI-powered assistant designed to answer questions about sustainability, environmental impact, and climate change. It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), web search capabilities, and large language models to provide accurate and informative responses to sustainability-related queries.

## Features

- **Hybrid Knowledge System**: Combines document-based knowledge with real-time web search
- **RAG Architecture**: Uses sustainability reports from major companies as a knowledge base
- **Web Search Fallback**: Automatically falls back to web search when the knowledge base doesn't have an answer
- **Renewable Energy News**: Daily updated top 5 news about renewable energy developments
- **Email Functionality**: Send responses directly to teammates or colleagues
- **Streamlit UI**: User-friendly interface with a landing page for multiple features
- **Daily Sustainability Tips**: Provides daily tips for sustainable living
- **Response Modes**: Choose between concise or detailed responses

## Architecture

SustainaBOT is built with a modular architecture:

1. **Document Processing**:
   - PDF loading from sustainability reports
   - Text chunking and embedding
   - FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval

2. **Query Processing**:
   - RAG chain for document-based answers
   - Web search fallback using Tavily API
   - Response formatting and cleaning

3. **User Interface**:
   - Streamlit-based web application with landing page
   - News section with clickable source links
   - Chat interface for sustainability Q&A
   - Email functionality for sharing results

4. **Models**:
   - Groq LLM integration (llama3-70b-8192)
   - HuggingFace embeddings for document vectorization

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- API keys for Groq and Tavily
- SMTP credentials for email functionality

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivambomble/SustainaBOT.git
   cd SustainaBOT
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure API keys:
   - Create or modify `config/config.py` with your API keys:
   ```python
   GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"
   TAVILY_API_KEY = "your_tavily_api_key"
   SMTP_CONFIG = {
       "EMAIL": "your_email@gmail.com",
       "PASSWORD": "your_app_password"
   }
   ```

4. Build the vector database:
   ```bash
   python build_vector_store.py
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Landing Page

The application now features a landing page with two main options:

1. **Renewable Energy News**: View the top 5 latest news about renewable energy with links to original sources
